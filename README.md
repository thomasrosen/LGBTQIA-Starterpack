## The Files

The files are in the [yaml format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML). This is readable by humans, but also parsable by computers.

[Glossaries](Glossaries.yml): What do all the queer words mean? Here's a list of websites that provide definitions.

[Maps](Maps.yml): Maps of queer places and lists of queer organisations.

[Online-Communities](Online-Communities.yml): Chat and dating websites for queer people.

[Helplines](Helplines.yml): Helplines for emergencies.
